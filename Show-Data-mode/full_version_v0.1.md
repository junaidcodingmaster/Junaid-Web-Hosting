You want more `data` slots you can edit it like:
`data1,data2`
you are thinking what is this `data` slots. right!

`data` slots means this ` function showAllData = (permission, data)` here you can see this `data` in function , you can increase this like 
` function showAllData = (permission, data1,data2)`
this was i am talking.
